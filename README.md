# Toxic Comment Classification

This project was developed in the course of Architettura degli Elaboratori 2, at University of Cagliari. The aim was to provide an alternative solution to the Kaggle Challenge at https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge

### Prerequisites

The project runs on Apache Spark, so you need to install the version 2.3.1 and it is developed in Python. 

To run the project, you need to install the following libraries:
```
pip install pandas numpy scipy 
```
To improve the accuracy of the model, word embeddings have been used. They can be downloaded at http://www.maurodragoni.com/research/opinionmining/dranziera/embeddings-evaluation.php
